# encrypted-socket-chat
CS 456. Implement a simple socket-based chat protocol that uses a public-key cryptosystem (RSA or ElGamal)  with a secret-key cryptosystem (DES or AES) in a programming language of your choice. Allow the users to  choose the prime bit-length used for RSA/ElGamal and the secret passphrase used in DES/AES.
